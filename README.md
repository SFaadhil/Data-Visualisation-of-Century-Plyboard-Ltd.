# Data-Visualisation-of-Century-Plyboard-Ltd.
A simple python program using tkinter, numpy, panda's, and matplot to analyse and visualise the yearly and quaterly data of the Plywood manufacturing company, Century Plyboard Ltd.

The financial data for the company was found from the website "screener.in" and here's the [link](https://www.screener.in/company/CENTURYPLY/consolidated/) for the same 
You can even view the data as a Google Sheet file [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nrrIKfDPQAam_RtpNbRLJdZTVTK1y8SeiRtgzxDxy7M/edit?gid=2138882074#gid=2138882074)

The data was then converted into .csv format so it can be used for better and faster processing. 

Here's a list of the available data :
-Profit and Loss from the year 2016
-Quaterly statistics from June 2023
-Balance sheet from March 2016
-Cashflow from March 2016

From which only the Profit and Loss sheet was used alongside the Quaterly Statistics sheet.

**Dropdown Feature** :
_The dropdown feature is a very convenient way of sorting and visualising data as it allows us to generate a sub-view of the entire set of data according to the self-made parameters_

**Yearly Charts** :
After analysing the yearly data 2016 onwards, some basic graphs can be derived as seen in the code, which includes a mix of both line and bar graphs.

**Quaterly Charts** :
Personally wanted to see whether I could make the window scrollable and add all the quaterly graphs in one place like a dashboard and that's how it has been implemented as well.

**Note : The CSV files used in the code have been attached as well and the code needs to have the filepath for the csv files updated accordingly**
